<H1>Hello, welcome to the repository.</H1>
<h3>What is this project?</h3>
To be honest, this might not be very interesting for you.
I just want to keep track of my learning journey, so GitHub is the space to be!

As a way of learning java programming, databases, and other skills that are required for my Bachelor's degree, I had the idea to develop a pokemon-ish game, so I can combine multiple aspects of learning and keep track of my progress.

This repository will contain all my code changes, maybe some logs and maybe someday other people can help collaborate!

<h3>What do I hope to achieve?</h3>
Maybe at some point I will allow others to collaborate on the project with me.
But seeing as this is MY learning journey, it is very important to me that I learn something in every single thing that gets added to the project.
However, that does not mean people won't be able to help, and ofcourse they should be credited properly.

<h4>Credit's due where credit's due</h4>
When I was starting the project I had no clue how to do anything without a game engine, like Unity, Godot or Unreal Engine. So that is when I went on the internet and started searching for tutorials and information. 

*I quickly found an amazing youtuber called [RyiSnow](https://www.youtube.com/@RyiSnow) who's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=om59cwR7psI&list=PL_QPQmz5C6WUF-pOQDsbsKbaBZqXj4qSq) I followed for the larger part to get everything up and running.*

Without him this would not have been possible, so please, check him out. 


Have a nice day :)
