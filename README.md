<H1>Hello, welcome to the repository.</H1>

I don't think you will find anything interesting here, to be honest..
I just want to keep track of my learning journey, so Github is the space to be!

This repository will contain all my code changes, maybe some logs and maybe someday other people can help collaborate!

When I was starting the project I had no clue how to do anything without a game engine, so I quickly found an amazing youtuber called RyiSnow who's tutorial I followed for the larger part to get everything up and running.
Without him this would not have been possible, so please, check him out. 


Have a nice day :)
